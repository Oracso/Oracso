# Oscar Hardy - GitHub  Profile

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ™‚

Email: oscarhardy@hotmail.co.uk


## About Me:

I've been writing primarily object-oriented code for the last 3+ years and through this have developed an understanding of ***Software Development***, ***Data Engineering*** and ***Digital/Transformation Architecture***. 

The majority of my code is written in Swift, as it enables me to combine complex functionality and logic that seamlessly integrate with a practical and engaging UI.

Through the optimisation and automation of processes for increased productivity, coupled with the analysis and structuring of complex data to facilitate informed decision-making, I develop concise and sustainable strategies that address business needs whilst incorporating intuitive UI to engage clientele.

If you are a <ins>recruiter</ins> or an <ins>employer</ins>, please reach out, I enjoy speaking to people and working on interesting projects :)
