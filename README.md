# Oscar Hardy - GitHub  Profile

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ™‚

Email: oscarhardy@hotmail.co.uk

## About Me:

Driven by a desire and passion for efficiency and simplicity, I began writing code to make life simpler. 

In doing so, I've solved challenges that optimised and automated processes to enhance productivity, analysed and structured complex data to enable informed decision making, and crafted intuitive User Interfaces that engage clientele. 

By pragmatically building applications within realistic timelines and incorporating current demands with future potential, I accomplish key business objectives that facilitate and drive growth.

I aim to bring the same approach to your organisation, writing code that is generic and modularised, maximising its applicability and scalability.

All consultations and communications are of course FREE, I enjoy speaking to people :)
